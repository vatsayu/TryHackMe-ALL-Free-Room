# TryHackMe: Nmap Writeup

**Room**: [Nmap](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap01)  
**Difficulty**: Beginner

## Overview
The **Nmap** room teaches network scanning with Nmap to identify open ports, services, and system details, a key step in pentesting reconnaissance.

## Tools Used
- Nmap (on TryHackMe AttackBox).
- TryHackMe VPN.

## Methodology
1. **Basic Scan**:
   - Run `nmap <target_ip>` to list open ports (e.g., 22/SSH, 80/HTTP).
   - Counted open ports for the task question.
2. **Service Version Detection**:
   - Used `nmap -sV <target_ip>` to find service versions (e.g., OpenSSH 7.6).
   - Answered questions about specific services.
3. **Aggressive Scan**:
   - Ran `nmap -A <target_ip>` to detect OS and additional details.
   - Identified the targetâ€™s OS from the output.
4. **Specific Port Scanning**:
   - Scanned with `nmap -p 80,443 <target_ip>` to check HTTP/HTTPS.
   - Confirmed open/closed ports.

## Key Learnings
- Mastered Nmap syntax (`-sV`, `-A`, `-p`).
- Learned to interpret scan results for ports and services.
- Practiced saving outputs (`nmap -oN output.txt`).

## Screenshots
*(Add screenshot of Nmap output)*  
To add: Capture `nmap -A <target_ip>` as `nmap_scan.png`.

## Challenges Faced
- Used `-Pn` flag when the host appeared down (`nmap -Pn <target_ip>`).
- Ensured VPN was connected.

## Next Steps
- Apply Nmap skills in rooms like Vulnversity.
